# Static analysis failures — {{TASK}}

All tests are passing but the following type-check / lint errors must be fixed
before this task can be considered complete.

Fix **only** the reported issues. Do not refactor unrelated code, change logic,
or alter function signatures beyond what is strictly required to silence the
errors.
