# Documentation pass — {{TASK}}

Tests are passing. Without changing any logic, signatures, or tests, update or create `README.md` at the project root with these four sections:

1. **What it is** — one-paragraph summary.
2. **Structure** — directory tree with a one-line description per module.
3. **How to run** — exact install + run commands.
4. **How to test** — exact command to run the test suite.

Keep sections that are still accurate; update only what has changed.
