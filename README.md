# agentik

An autonomous development pipeline that drives
[opencode](https://opencode.ai) through a full **build → test → fix → commit**
pipeline for every task defined in a project ROADMAP.

Write a structured `ROADMAP.json`, run `python agentik.py`, and let AI agents
implement your project task by task — with git history, cost tracking, parallel
builds, and resume support built in.

## Features

- **Zero-touch pipeline** — build, test, fix, lint, and commit in one loop,
  fully automated
- **Parallel builds** — independent tasks run concurrently (dependency-aware
  scheduling)
- **Multi-ecosystem** — auto-detects Python, Deno, Node/TS, Go, Rust; any
  ecosystem works with manual config
- **Budget tracking** — monthly token limits, per-project cost logs, estimated
  USD spend
- **Resume on Ctrl-C** — saves state after every phase; pick up exactly where
  you left off
- **Milestone gates** — semver tagging and merge-to-main via `agent: milestone`
  tasks
- **Deploy hooks** — provider-agnostic deployment via ROADMAP `deploy` block
- **Agent logs** — every opencode call logged with timestamp, phase, and attempt
  number
- **Git managed (opt-in)** — automatic branching, commits, merges, and tags
  when enabled
- **ROADMAP generation** — describe a project in plain English and let an AI
  agent generate a valid `ROADMAP.json` for you
- **Test coverage gating** — enforce minimum coverage thresholds; the pipeline
  fails if coverage drops below the configured percentage
- **Git rollback on failure** — automatically revert feature branch changes
  when a task exceeds max attempts
- **Webhook notifications** — send pipeline events (task complete, task failed,
  pipeline done) to Slack, Discord, or any HTTP endpoint
- **Structured error diagnostics** — JSON failure reports saved per task with
  last error, failing test, attempt count, and token spend
- **Interactive HTML dependency graph** — open a standalone graph in your
  browser with colour-coded status and token budgets
- **Web UI dashboard** — React + Tailwind + shadcn frontend with live
  WebSocket updates, 9 tabs (Overview, Graph, Tasks, Logs, Editor, Budget,
  Generate, Models, Controls), Monaco JSON editor, React Flow
  dependency graph, project creation wizard, and full pipeline control via
  REST API

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- [opencode](https://opencode.ai) installed and on PATH (or use Docker — see below)
- An LLM provider configured in `opencode.jsonc` (e.g. GitHub Copilot,
  Anthropic, OpenAI)

### Install (local)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlockAIx/agentik.git
cd agentik
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install (Docker — recommended)

Docker bundles Python, opencode, Node.js, and all dependencies in a single
image. No host-level installs required beyond Docker itself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlockAIx/agentik.git
cd agentik
cp .env.example .env          # edit with your API keys
./scripts/start.sh            # Linux/macOS
.\scripts\start.ps1           # Windows PowerShell
```

Or use docker compose directly:

```bash
docker compose up              # web UI at http://localhost:8420
docker compose run agentik --pipeline   # interactive pipeline
```

See [Docker setup](#docker-setup) below for full details.

### Create a project

Create a folder under `projects/` with a `ROADMAP.json`. You can write it by
hand or **ask any AI model** to generate it for you — the workspace-level
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains the full ROADMAP schema, task field reference,
and ecosystem conventions, so a model working from the repository root has all
the context it needs.

Example prompt for a new project:

> Create a new project `projects/my-api/ROADMAP.json` for a Python REST API
> with three modules: models, routes, and auth. Follow the ROADMAP format in
> AGENTS.md. Include proper depends_on ordering, outputs, and acceptance
> criteria. Then validate it with
> `python check_roadmap.py projects/my-api/ROADMAP.json`.

To add tasks to an existing project:

> Read `projects/my-api/ROADMAP.json` and add tasks 4–6 for WebSocket support:
> a connection manager, event handlers, and integration tests. Continue the
> existing id sequence and set depends_on correctly. Validate with
> `python check_roadmap.py projects/my-api/ROADMAP.json`.

You can also start from a minimal hand-written file:

```
projects/
  my-project/
    ROADMAP.json
```

```json
{
  "name": "My Project v0.1",
  "ecosystem": "python",
  "preamble": "",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Core Module",
      "depends_on": [],
      "outputs": ["my_project/core.py", "tests/test_core.py"],
      "acceptance": "all tests in tests/test_core.py pass",
      "description": "Implement `greet(name: str) -> str` returning `\"Hello, <name>!\"`.\nTests: normal input, empty string, non-ASCII."
    }
  ]
}
```

See [ROADMAP_EXAMPLE.md](ROADMAP_EXAMPLE.md) for the full syntax reference.

### Run

```bash
python agentik.py
```

An arrow-key project selector appears, then pick a mode:

- **Run pipeline** — work through every uncompleted task
- **Run pipeline (verbose)** — same, but stream full agent output
- **Show dependency graph** — colour-coded task graph in terminal
- **Open interactive graph** — launch a graph in your browser
- **Generate ROADMAP from description** — describe a project, get a valid ROADMAP
- **Generate project AGENTS.md** — create or regenerate per-project agent instructions
- **Start web UI** — launch the React dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:8420`

Press **Ctrl-C** at any time to save state and resume later.

## How it works

For each task agentik executes:

| #  | Phase    | What happens                                                           |
|----|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Build    | opencode agent implements the module + unit tests                      |
| 2  | Deps     | Installs any new dependencies the agent declared                       |
| 3  | Test     | Runs ecosystem test suite (pytest / deno test / cargo test / etc.)     |
| 4  | Coverage | Runs tests with coverage; fails if below `min_coverage` threshold      |
| 5  | Fix      | If tests fail → fix agent patches code (same session, up to N retries) |
| 6  | Static   | Lint & type checks (ruff / deno check+lint / tsc / go vet / clippy)    |
| 7  | Stfix    | If static checks fail → fix agent resolves them (up to 2 retries)      |
| 8  | Commit   | `git add → commit → merge to develop` (when git is managed)           |
| 9  | Notify   | Send webhook notification for pipeline events (if configured)          |
| 10 | Deploy   | Runs deploy script if configured in ROADMAP (optional)                 |

**Milestone tasks** follow a different pipeline:

| #  | Phase          | What happens                                                         |
|----|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Review         | Milestone agent inspects project state (read-only)                   |
| 2  | Milestone fix  | If verdict is CONDITIONAL PASS or FAIL → fix agent addresses issues  |
| 3  | Static checks  | Lint & type checks after fixes (if any were applied)                 |
| 4  | Tag & merge    | Semver tag on develop, merge, commit                                 |

```

Each project under `projects/` is its own directory. When git is managed
(`"git": {"enabled": true}` in ROADMAP), each project gets its own git
repository with automatic branching and commits.

## ROADMAP.json reference

### Task fields

| Field         | Required           | Type             | Description                            |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | **yes**            | integer          | Unique task ID                         |
| `title`       | **yes**            | string           | Short imperative title (≤ 6 words)     |
| `depends_on`  | **yes**            | array of ints    | Task IDs this depends on (or `[]`)     |
| `outputs`     | **yes**\*          | array of strings | Expected output files                  |
| `acceptance`  | **yes**\*          | string           | Human-readable done criterion          |
| `description` | no                 | string           | Full task spec (can contain markdown)  |
| `agent`       | no                 | string           | Override agent (default: `"build"`)    |
| `context`     | no                 | array of strings | Files pre-injected into the build prompt |
| `version`     | no                 | string           | Semver tag (milestone tasks only)      |
| `deploy`      | no                 | boolean          | Run deploy hook after this task        |

\* Required for all tasks except `agent: "milestone"` tasks.

### Preamble

Everything outside the `tasks` array — `name`, `ecosystem`, and `preamble` — is
project-level config. The `preamble` string is injected into every build prompt
as project context, so architecture notes defined once guide every task.

### Validation

```bash
python check_roadmap.py projects/<name>/ROADMAP.json
```

Checks numbering, required fields, dependency references, single root task
(exactly one `depends_on: []`), disjoint parallel outputs, title length,
architecture rules, and unknown fields.

## Agents

![agentik](assets/agents.png)

Defined in `opencode.jsonc`. agentik selects the right agent per phase;
`agent:` in the ROADMAP only controls the first-pass build.

| Agent       | Writes files | Role                                                |
| ----------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`     | yes          | Implement module + unit tests + README update       |
| `fix`       | yes          | Repair failing tests (continues build session)      |
| `architect` | no           | Design / ADRs (use via task, not automatic)          |
| `milestone` | no           | Review gate + semver tag on develop (triggers fix on issues) |

## Budget and cost tracking

Configure in `budget.json`:

```json
{
  "monthly_limit_tokens": 2000000000,
  "per_task_limit_tokens": 2000000,
  "max_attempts_per_task": 4,
  "max_parallel_agents": 3,
  "token_prices_usd_per_million": {
    "input": 1.25,
    "output": 5.00,
    "cache_read": 0.31,
    "cache_write": 1.25
  }
}
```

- **Monthly limit** — agentik aborts (exit 2) when exceeded
- **Per-task limit** — reserved for future enforcement
- **Max attempts** — fix retries before abandoning a task
- **Token prices** — used to estimate USD cost in the status table

Every run displays a status table with token usage, estimated cost, progress
bar, and ETA.

## Parallel builds

When `max_parallel_agents > 1`, independent tasks (no dependency edges between
them) run concurrently. The build phase is parallel; test and static phases run
once per batch.

**Important:** parallel tasks must not have overlapping `outputs:` or modify
shared files. The validator enforces disjoint outputs for tasks that share the
same dependency set. Only one task may have `depends_on: []` (the project
foundation, layer 0).

## Git workflow (opt-in)

Git management is **off by default**. Enable it per project:

```json
{ "git": { "enabled": true } }
```

When enabled:

```
main  ←  develop  ←  feature/<slug>  (per task)
```

Each task is committed on `feature/<slug>`, merged to `develop`, and tagged
`task-<NNN>`. Milestone tasks tag `develop` with a semver tag.

When git is **not** managed, agentik skips all git operations. You can use
your own version control workflow.

## Deploy hook (optional)

Deployment is **opt-in and provider-agnostic**. Add a top-level `deploy` block
to your `ROADMAP.json`:

```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "enabled": true,
    "script": "scripts/deploy.sh",
    "env": { "provider": "fly", "app": "my-app", "region": "fra" }
  }
}
```

- `enabled` — master switch (default `true`)
- `script` — path to deploy script relative to project (default `scripts/deploy.sh` or `.ps1`)
- `env` — key-value pairs injected as `DEPLOY_*` environment variables

**Per-task gating:** add `"deploy": true` to specific tasks. When any task has
a `deploy` field, only those marked `true` trigger the hook.

**Suppress deployment:**
- `RUNNER_NO_DEPLOY=1` — global suppression
- `deploy.enabled: false` in the ROADMAP — per-project opt-out

**Backward compatibility:** if no ROADMAP `deploy` block exists, agentik
falls back to reading a `deploy.json` file at the project root.

## Agent logs

Every opencode invocation is logged to `projects/<name>/logs/<task-slug>/`:

```
logs/<task-slug>/<yyyymmdd_HHMMSS>_<phase>_a<attempt>.log
```

In **compact mode** (default), only status lines appear in the terminal. On
failure, the last 40 log lines are shown inline. In **verbose mode**, all agent
output streams in real time. Logs are gitignored automatically.

## State and resume

Progress is stored in `projects/<name>/.runner_state.json` and committed to the
project repo. Adding new tasks to a ROADMAP works seamlessly — completed tasks
are skipped, new ones are picked up automatically.

## Supported ecosystems

agentik auto-detects these ecosystems from manifest files. Any ecosystem
works — set `"ecosystem": "<name>"` in your ROADMAP and agentik will use
it as-is (unknown values produce a warning, not an error).

| Ecosystem | Manifest           | Test runner       | Static checks              |
| --------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Python    | `requirements.txt` | `pytest`          | `ruff`                     |
| Deno      | `deno.json`        | `deno test`       | `deno check` + `deno lint` |
| Node      | `package.json`     | `vitest` / `jest` | `tsc --noEmit`             |
| Go        | `go.mod`           | `go test`         | `go vet`                   |
| Rust      | `Cargo.toml`       | `cargo test`      | `cargo clippy`             |

## Web UI

agentik includes an optional web dashboard built with React, Tailwind CSS, and
shadcn/ui. It provides a browser-based interface to monitor and control the
pipeline.

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]
```

### Launch

Select **Start web UI** from the agentik menu, or run directly:

```bash
python -c "from web.app import start_server; start_server()"
```

The dashboard opens at `http://127.0.0.1:8420` with these tabs:

| Tab        | Description                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview   | Stats cards, progress bar, token usage chart, project info     |
| Graph      | React Flow dependency graph with colour-coded task status      |
| Tasks      | Sortable task table with status badges, agents, and tokens     |
| Logs       | Log tree per task with inline failure report display           |
| Editor     | Monaco JSON editor for ROADMAP.json with save and validate     |
| Budget     | Monaco JSON editor for per-project budget.json                 |
| Generate   | Describe a project → AI generates a valid ROADMAP.json         |
| Models     | Per-agent model configuration with live connection testing     |
| Controls   | Run/stop pipeline with live log streaming                      |

Live updates are pushed over WebSocket — no polling needed.

### Developing the frontend

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server with API proxy to :8420
npm run build        # production build → web/static/
```

## Test coverage gating

Enforce minimum test coverage by adding to your `ROADMAP.json`:

```json
{ "min_coverage": 80 }
```

The pipeline runs tests with coverage collection after the standard test phase.
If coverage falls below the threshold, the task is treated as failed and enters
the fix cycle.

## Webhook notifications

Send events to any HTTP endpoint (Slack, Discord, custom). Add to your
`ROADMAP.json`:

```json
{
  "notify": {
    "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...",
    "events": ["task_complete", "task_failed", "pipeline_done"]
  }
}
```

Events are sent as JSON POST requests. Notification failures are logged but
never break the pipeline.

## Git rollback on failure

When git is managed and a task exceeds `max_attempts_per_task`, the runner
automatically hard-resets the feature branch to the last clean commit. This
prevents broken code from accumulating on feature branches. Rollback only
applies when `"git": {"enabled": true}` is set.

## Docker setup

agentik ships with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that bundle the
entire stack: Python 3.12, opencode CLI (Go binary), Node.js + pnpm, git, and
the pre-built web UI.

### Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # add your LLM API keys
./scripts/start.sh     # builds + starts the web UI (Linux/macOS)
.\scripts\start.ps1    # same for Windows PowerShell
```

### docker compose commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `docker compose up` | Build image + start web UI at `:8420` |
| `docker compose up -d` | Detached mode |
| `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` | Dev mode with hot-reload |
| `docker compose run --rm agentik --pipeline` | Interactive pipeline |
| `docker compose down` | Stop and remove containers |

### Start script flags

The scripts in `scripts/` wrap docker compose for convenience:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| *(none)* or `--web` | Build + start web UI |
| `--dev` | Dev mode — hot-reload frontend (HMR) + backend |
| `--pipeline` | Interactive pipeline mode |
| `--build-only` | Build the Docker image only |
| `--detach` / `-d` | Start web UI in background |
| `--down` / `--stop` | Stop containers |

### Environment variables

Configure via `.env` (loaded automatically by docker compose):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `OPENCODE_API_KEY` | opencode auth token |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Copilot token |
| `OPENCODE_CMD` | Override opencode binary path (default: `opencode`) |
| `AGENTIK_PORT` | Web UI port (default: `8420`) |

### Volumes

The compose file mounts:
- `./projects` → `/app/projects` — your project data persists on the host
- `./opencode.jsonc` → `/app/opencode.jsonc` — edit models without rebuilding
- `./budget.json` → `/app/budget.json` — adjust budgets without rebuilding
- `pnpm_store` → `/pnpm-store` — pnpm content-addressable store (named volume, persists across rebuilds)
- `pnpm_vstore` → `/pnpm-vstore` — pnpm virtual stores per project (named volume)

The `pnpm_store` and `pnpm_vstore` named volumes keep pnpm's heavy I/O off the
bind-mounted projects directory. This is critical on **Windows and macOS** Docker
where bind-mount performance is orders of magnitude slower than native
filesystem access — without these volumes, `pnpm install` for Node/TS projects
can take 10–30× longer.

### Building manually

```bash
docker build -t agentik .
docker run -it --rm -v ./projects:/app/projects -p 8420:8420 agentik
```

### Dev mode (hot-reload)

Dev mode mounts your source code into the container and runs Vite (HMR) +
uvicorn (`--reload`) so both frontend and backend changes are reflected
instantly without rebuilding the image:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh --dev      # Linux/macOS
.\scripts\start.ps1 --dev     # Windows

# Or directly:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

| URL | What |
|-----|------|
| `http://localhost:5173` | Frontend with HMR (use this during development) |
| `http://localhost:8420` | Backend API (proxied automatically from :5173) |

The Vite dev server proxies `/api` and `/ws` requests to the FastAPI backend.
Edit files in `web/frontend/src/` for instant browser updates, or `web/app.py`,
`runner/`, `helpers/` for backend changes that auto-restart uvicorn.
