# Each project has its own standalone git repo — never track them here.
# Git treats a subdirectory containing a .git folder as a "nested repo"
# (gitlink) unless it is explicitly ignored. Ignoring the whole projects/
# directory is the safest way to guarantee nothing leaks into the workspace
# repo: no project source files, no project .git objects, no budget.json.
